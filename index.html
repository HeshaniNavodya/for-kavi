    <h1>Hey Kavi ðŸ’•</h1>

    <p>
I will never forget these dates, you were so humble and gentle with me, you made me feel included, you were really kind and you kept talking to me. After I got drunk (idk if I seemed drunk) you took my hand and rushed to the beach (I have no idea why u felt the need to rush). 

I remember resting my head on your chest â€” 
1. Thanks for letting me. It felt like heaven for sure.  
I don't remember much ofc but I remember you kissing my head. It felt better too :)  

I remember telling you that I needed to sit, you were rubbing my shoulder, massaging my head. I remember all that :)  
2. Thanks for doing that. I've never had such a thing in my lifeee.  

You took good care of me (Even though I blamed you, scolded you for kissing me without my consent, kissing you felt right for some reason. I apologize for blaming you for that â€” I apologize from the bottom of my heart. I know I did a mistake).  

Even after I vomited you carried me â€” literally like a princess. I have no idea how to explain how that felt :)  
3. Thanks for keeping me on your lap and letting me rest.

It really was a good day indeed, the bestest day for sure.  

But since very recently I donâ€™t feel that from you... I feel like you donâ€™t like to have me around, you donâ€™t like to even hold my hand. (Even when we hung out at the Joint Pub â€” I know you took really good care of me, but at the beginning it felt like you didnâ€™t give a damn about me. Um, sorry for saying this.)  

Can you be like my old Kavi, please? I miss him.  
Can I have him back? ðŸ¥º  
I don't wanna loose you , I promise you this is gonna be the last time, I ll lwt you go if this happens again, I promise 

I know I suck.  
Promise this will be the last time :)
