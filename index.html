        <h1>For My Kavi</h1>

        <p class="date">2025.06.29/30</p>

        <p>I will never forget these dates. You were so **humble and gentle** with me, you made me feel **included**. You were really kind and you kept talking to me.</p>

        <p>After I got drunk (I don't know if I seemed drunk) you took my hand and rushed to the beach (I have no idea why you felt the need to rush).</p>

        <p>I remember resting my head on your chest... <span class="thanks">1. Thanks for letting me</span>, It felt like **heaven** for sure. I don't remember much of course but I remember you kissing my head, It felt better too.</p>

        <p>I remember telling you that I needed to sit, you were rubbing my shoulder and massaging my head, I remember all that. <span class="thanks">2. Thanks for doing that</span>, I've never had such a thing in my life.</p>

        <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #1e88e5; margin: 25px 0;">

        <p class="apology">
            (Even though I blamed you and scolded you for kissing me without my consent... kissing you felt right for some reason. I **apologize** for blaming you for that, I apologize from the **bottom of my heart**. I know I made a mistake.)
        </p>

        <p>Even after I vomited you carried me literally like a **princess**. I have no idea how to explain how that felt. <span class="thanks">3. Thanks for keeping me on your lap and letting me rest.</span></p>

        <p>It really was a **good day** indeed, a **bestest day** for sure.</p>

        <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #1e88e5; margin: 25px 0;">

        <p>But since very recently I don't feel that from you. I feel like you don't like to have me around, you don't like to even hold my hand. (Even when we hung out at the joint pub, I know you took really good care of me, but at the beginning it felt like you didn't give a damn about me. I'm so sorry for saying this).</p>

        <div class="miss">
            Can you be like my **old kavi** please, I miss him. Can I have him back?
        </div>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">I know I suck.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #1e88e5;">Promise this will be the **last time**.</p>
    </div>
