        <h1>For My Kavi ✨</h1>

        <p>2025.06.29/30 🗓️</p>

        <p>I will never forget these dates. You were so **humble and gentle** with me, you made me feel **included** 🥰. You were really kind and you kept talking to me.</p>

        <p>After I got drunk (idk if I seemed drunk 😅) you took my hand and rushed to the beach (I have no idea why you felt the need to rush 🏃‍♀️💨).</p>

        <p>I remember resting my head on your chest... <span class="thanks">1. Thanks for letting me</span>, It felt like **heaven** for sure 🥺. I don't remember much ofc but I remember you kissing my head, It felt better too. 😊</p>

        <p>I remember telling you that I needed to sit, you were rubbing my shoulder and massaging my head, I remember all that. <span class="thanks">2. Thanks for doing that</span>, I've never had such a thing in my lifeee. You took good care of me.</p>

        <p>***</p>

        <p class="apology">
            (Even though I blamed you and scolded you for kissing me without my consent... kissing you felt right for some reason. I **apologize** for blaming you for that, I apologize from the **bottom of my heart** 😔. I know I made a mistake.)
        </p>

        <p>Even after I vomited you carried me literally like a **princess** 👑. I have no idea how to explain how that felt. <span class="thanks">3. Thanks for keeping me on your lap and letting me rest.</span></p>

        <p>It really was a **good day** indeed, a **bestest day** for sure! 🌟</p>

        <p>***</p>

        <p>But since very recently I don't feel that from you 💔. I feel like you don't like to have me around, you don't like to even hold my hand 😔. (Even when we hung out at the joint pub, I know you took really good care of me, but at the beginning it felt like you didn't give a damn about me. Um so sorry for saying this 🙏).</p>

        <div class="miss">
            Can you be like my **old kavi** please, I miss him. Can I have him back? 🫂
        </div>

        <p>I know I suck. 😞</p>

        <p>Promise this will be the **last time**... 🤞</p>
    </div>
